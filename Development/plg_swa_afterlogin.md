This plugin, allows for attaching code to the afterlogin event. This was used to check for a current agreement signed [[club_agreements]]. It is redundant but might be useful for future hooks.


Code for this in development can be found [[..\src\plugin\afterlogin]]
When built, its path will be `/public_html/plugins/swa/afterlogin`
